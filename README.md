# Excel

ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) - I extracted data from a CSV file into Excel, performed transformations using Power Query, and loaded the refined data back into Excel.

Power Query - This technique allowed me to efficiently transform and connect data from various sources.

Data Modeling - I connected different dimension tables to a central fact table, resulting in the creation of a star schema.

Pivot Table - I utilized Pivot Tables to summarize and analyze the integrated data.
